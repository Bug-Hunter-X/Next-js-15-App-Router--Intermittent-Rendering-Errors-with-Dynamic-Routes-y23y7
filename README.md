# Next.js 15 App Router: Intermittent Rendering Errors with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and data fetching.  Under certain conditions (seemingly random), routes fail to render properly, resulting in blank pages or stale data.

## Reproducing the Issue

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to various routes.  You should intermittently observe rendering failures.

## Potential Causes

- Suspected issues with the `fetch` function or data fetching within the `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` functions.
- Timing issues in the rendering process. 
- Potentially an edge case in the Next.js 15 app directory implementation.

## Workaround

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the solutions implemented to address the bug, involving more robust error handling and data management techniques.
